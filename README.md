# Maths Review
The general aim for this is to have the computer ask maths questions on a variety of topics. Each question will have a rating (kind of like a chess ELO). So will the user. These ratings will change in the same way as ratings change when chess players win or lose a game of change. Generally: a strong user answering a weak question will result in hardly any change. But a weak user answering a hard question will lower the rating of the question and raise the rating of the user -- by quite a bit.

I aim to allow the user to be able to select questions (by subject or difficulty). And the computer can also select questions (to review a topic and also to challenge the user with questions they haven't seen before.) Many questions will also have links to online resources (BBC bitesize, for one).
